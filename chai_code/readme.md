# Learning from 30days of javascript

## Day1
- expect number, string, boolean, bigint and symbol all the other data type will show object in "typeof" instance

## Day2
- The == operator compares the values of two variables after performing type conversion if necessary.On the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two variables without performing type conversion.

- function constructor Explation later will be updated

## Day3
-  To use a switch statement for handling ranges, you can use a technique called "fall-through" by not using break statements until the appropriate range is found. This approach involves intentionally not breaking out of the switch statement until the correct case is reached.

## Day4
- The do...while statements combo defines a code block to be executed once, and repeated as long as a condition is true.
- The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop) {skip}, if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
- The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.
